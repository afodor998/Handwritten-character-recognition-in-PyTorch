# Handwritten-character-recognition-in-PyTorch
This Jupyter Notebook implements an end-to-end character recognition pipeline. It guides you through loading and preprocessing image data, defining a neural network model, training it, and evaluating its performance using numerical metrics.

This notebook provides a complete workflow for character recognition. The main components include:

Data Loading: Reading and displaying image files.

Image Preprocessing: Converting images to grayscale, reducing noise, and applying thresholding to prepare the images.

Model Definition: Building a neural network (e.g., a Convolutional Neural Network) with layers suitable for character recognition.

Training Process: Training the network on the preprocessed image data and updating the model parameters using an optimization algorithm.

Evaluation: Measuring the model's performance using numerical metrics (such as loss and accuracy).
# Key Features
Image Data Loading:
    - The notebook imports image files from a designated source to verify that the correct data is being used for processing.

## Image Preprocessing:
The steps include:
   - Converting images to grayscale.
   - Reducing noise to clean the images.
   - Applying thresholding (binarization) to enhance the contrast between characters and the background.

## Neural Network Model:
The model defined in the notebook includes:

   - Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
     
   - Pooling layers to reduce data dimensionality.
   - Fully connected layers to classify the extracted features into character classes.

## Training and Evaluation:
The notebook trains the model using the preprocessed data and then evaluates its performance by calculating metrics such as accuracy and loss.

# Conclusion
This notebook offers a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to character recognition using image processing techniques and a neural network model. It is designed as a self-contained solution that walks you through the processâ€”from data loading and preprocessing to model training and numerical evaluation of performance. Future enhancements might include additional preprocessing techniques or alternative model architectures, depending on the project's evolution.
